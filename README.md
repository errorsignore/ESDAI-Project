# Sensitivity Analysis of Servopneumatic Systems

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of servopneumatic systems, focusing on speed governors. The project aims to understand how variations in key parameters like supply pressure (ps), load force (Fl), and settling time (ts) affect system outputs such as sonic conductance (C) and actuator area (A).

## Key Components
- Python scripts for calculating system behaviors and sensitivity.
- Sensitivity analysis results, exploring the impact of parameter variations.
- LaTeX documents for detailed explanation of methods and findings.

## Sensitivity Analysis
We employed a finite difference approach to estimate the sensitivity of the system outputs to changes in input parameters. This analysis helps in identifying critical parameters that significantly influence the system's behavior.

## Results
The sensitivity results indicate how changes in ps, Fl, and ts impact the values of C and A. These insights are crucial for optimizing the design and performance of servopneumatic systems.

## Repository Structure
- Python scripts for calculations and analysis.
- `docs/`: LaTeX documents and sensitivity analysis reports.
- `data/`: Data files and sensitivity analysis results.
